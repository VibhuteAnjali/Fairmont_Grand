    data: "A fabulous hotel with excellent traditional service. The rooms are very well kept and are very spacious. The hotel welcomed me very kindly and offered great concierge services. I was also surprised to learn that a tailor is also available on site which was great. The location of the hotel is very private and far away from the noise of Del Mar. While the rooms can be expensive, the service and quality is up to par, and it is well worth the experience. I would highly recommend this property to others who wish to have a classic hotel experience.",

    data: "Historic hotel in a fantastic location. First off, the hotel is historic so you must appreciate that. The grounds and service is amazing, dare I say incredible. Despite its unassuming appearance the hotel is large and lots to do. Several pools, games for kids, tennis, gym, and of course golf. I didnâ€™t golf, but course looks great. The food is really good. I came for business but there were also lots of kids. I think kids would enjoy this resort too if they like pool activities. If you come with family and can swallow the cost, spring for a poolside villa they look really great.",

    data: "Elegant with lots of interesting areas to explore. Excellent pools and we had a great group event with the pickleball instructor. Huge rooms with separate shower, toilet and giant soaking tub. Although our room was kind of musty smelling and the shower drain backed up - they probably need to clean out the drains. Beautiful golf course nestled into the canyon which you can also hike - some sections need a weed whacking as you have to go through an area with lots of bees from the flowers covering the trail. ",
